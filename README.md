Here are some ideas to get you started:

- I'm currently writing in my MarkDown tool, Obsidian. I commit my work here. Unfornately for you, for now it's private.

- ðŸŒ± I used to be improving my Vuejs skills, at work, with https://www.uneparole.com, and other personal projects for me and the Church

- I'm loving VitePress right now (it's simply awesome) : https://www.jmx.blue/

Have a nice day !
